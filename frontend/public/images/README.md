# Public Images Folder

Place site-wide static images here. Files in this directory are served at the `/images` URL path by Vite.

For example, a file stored at:

- frontend/public/images/ycs-hero.jpg

Will be available at:

- /images/ycs-hero.jpg

Currently referenced filenames in the codebase:

- ycs-hero.jpg (homepage hero background)
- ycs-prayer.png (old home section)
- ycs-service.png (old home section)
- ycs-fellowship.png (old home section)
- placeholder.png (optional placeholder)
- ycs-member-placeholder.png (member/profile fallback)
- ycs-placeholder.png (navbar avatar/logo)

You can replace these with your own assets or update the code to point to different filenames.

Recommended sizes:
- Hero (ycs-hero.jpg): 1920x800 or similar wide ratio
- Card/thumbnail images: ~1200x600, 800x400, or similar
- Small icons/avatars: 128x128 or 256x256
